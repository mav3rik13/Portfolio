The following shell has the commands cd, clr, dir, environ, echo, help, and quit.
I/O redirection must be done at the end of the call, with < for stdin, and > for stdout, they can be in either order
cd <directory> changes the working directory to <directory>
clr clears the screen
dir <directory> prints the contents of <directory> to the screen
environ prints the enviroment strings
echo repeats back the parameter to the shell
help displays help strings
quit exits the shell
piping can be done with a "|" between commands
can take a file as a command line argument instead of from the keyboard, but the shell assumes there is no formatting in the file, and that it contains only valid commands

This was done as a class assignment.
